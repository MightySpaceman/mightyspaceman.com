<h1>About Me</h1>
<div class="standard">
<p>
Hi - I'm a Tasmanian amateur programmer, first-time author and I guess you could call me a youtuber; although my channel only has 100 subscribers, and I haven't touched 
it for the months that I have been writing my book. I live in Hobart, the capital of Tasmania, which is a really nice place, right on a river...most people 
say that Tasmania is frigid and cold but, I can tell you, it can get warm (not that the rest of Australia considers 35 degrees particularly 'warm')
</p>
<p>
  I'm currently writing a book about the future of space exploration, which will release somewhere in the next month or so. 
  At the time of writing I have finished writing it at 125 pages, and pretty much fully edited it - I'm just performing the finishing touches and waiting for my test readers. When I release it on the 
  Kindle store, it will cost around $15 AUD. Buying it would really help me out but...shhhh...I've got a little secret for you...it will be free for the first 
  5 days.
<p>
  MightySpaceman, my username and my YouTube channel, was always meant to be about space exploration. And it still is. For the majority of my life I have been
  a big follower of anything to do with space - and even if I haven't seen a rocket launch in person yet,  space exploration is and will always be a lifelong passion.
  It's the main topic of my YouTube channel and, heck, I'm even writing a book about it now. I don't think I will ever lose interest in it.
