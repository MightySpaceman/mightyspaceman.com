<p>
Hi - I'm a Tasmanian amateur/learning programmer, newbie author, and aerospace enthusiast. I live in Hobart, the capital of Tasmania, which is a really nice place, right on a river...most people
say that Tasmania is frigid and cold but, I can tell you, it can get warm (not that the rest of Australia considers 35 degrees particularly 'warm')
</p>

  I recently finished writing a book on the future of space exploration - that took nearly the whole year - and finally released it on the kindle store! I'm currently
  waiting to see how that'll go in terms of success. Because of this, I am now able to dedicate myself to other projects, and I hope to get better at my programming
  skills. Right now I've decided to just learn JavaScript, since it has a lot of useful implementations and frameworks, as well as being a kinda mandatory skill in
  any developer's toolkit. Right as I am writing this I finished adding a light theme button to this website using it :) here, press this <input type="checkbox" id="theme">
</br></br>if you want to see what I get up to, I guess you could check out my github. Link on the contact page.
<p>
  MightySpaceman, my username and my YouTube channel, was always meant to be about space exploration. And it still is. For the majority of my life I have been
  a big follower of anything to do with space - and even if I haven't seen a rocket launch in person yet,  space exploration is and will always be a lifelong passion.
  It's the main topic of my YouTube channel and, heck, I'm even writing a book about it now. I don't think I will ever lose interest in it.
</p>
<p>
<br>But for now, the opposite of east is west, html cleanup is a pest, and tseb eht si weffrom :)  (that's one for max)
