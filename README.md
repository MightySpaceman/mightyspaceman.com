# MightySpaceman Website Repository
This is the repository for [https://mightyspaceman.com/](https://mightyspaceman.com/), which I use to update to netlify. The code is here if you want to see it, and feel free to check out the site as well.

Ensure all pages have a `<div class='footer'>` for the dark theme option to be generated.

## V6 Changelog
- Added light theme button
- Added Matrix contact link
- Cleaned up footer
- Cleaned up CSS for front page

## To do list for future updates
- Add Ancient Egypt banner to front page
